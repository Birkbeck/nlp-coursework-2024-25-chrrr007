Part1 Question 1(d):
The Flesch-Kincaid (“FK”) readability score is a way to measure the difficulty of a text. 
Meaning the formular outputs a score indicating how readable (easy or hard) a text is. 
It takes sentence length and syllable count into consideration. 

This works well with standard texts that follow conventional English patterns. 
However, for  texts which do not follow these patterns, have non-Western rhetorical structures, 
or use complex metaphors and abstract concepts, that make comprehension challenging the FK might be
a limited indicator for readability as it cannot pick up these patterns. 
Equally challenging are non-standard structures, contractions or colloquials.

Equally limitations of the FK score may occcure when dealing with complex ideas and concepts which are explained
with basic vocabulary in short sentences to make it easier readable, as for instance in philosophical texts
or mathematical proofs. Cognitive demands, conceptual difficulty and sophisticated abstract reasoning cannot
be detected by the formular. 

This is also valid when text contains specialized terminology, jargon, or technical concepts,
whilst generally written in basic vocabulary with short sentences. FK doesn’t count for required expert knowledge of a topic, highly technical or specific vocabulary and understanding in order to gain understanding of the text. 

So the FK score might indicate an easy read for the above, whilst it is incomprehensible for an untrained reader.
